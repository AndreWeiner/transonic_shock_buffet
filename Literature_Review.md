# Literature Review of Simulation of Transonic Shock Buffet phenomenon over the airfoil

We have performed the literature review of the previous simulations performed on the different airfoils considering various cases by the researchers in their respective research papers. Based on the the simulation, we have segregated the analysis of the data in different aspects.
